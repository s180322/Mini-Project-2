# Mini-Project-2

Snake encounters pose significant risks to both human populations and biodiversity.
Developing an automated system to detect snakes in their natural habitats can greatly aid in
preventing snakebite incidents and conserving endangered snake species. This research
presents a novel snake detection system that leverages machine learning techniques to identify
and classify snakes from images. The proposed snake detection system follows a multi-stage
pipeline. First, a diverse dataset of snake images and videos is collected and annotated with
bounding boxes around snake regions. Next, a feature extraction process utilizes deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract high-level representations from the images.
The CNN model used for feature extraction is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset to learn
generic visual features, followed by fine-tuning on the specific snake dataset to adapt to
snakespecific characteristics.Here in this repo I attached the document related to the project.
